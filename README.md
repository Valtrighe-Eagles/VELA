## What is VELA?
VELA, which stands for Valtrighe Eagles Logistic Agency, is a program that was created to **simplify the calculations of a shopkeeper** who does not know how to manage the transportation of his goods to minimize expenses.
<br>
Then again, less expense = more gain üí∏

## Why choose VELA?
Are the goods to be transported getting more and more and you don't know what is the most convenient way to ship them?
<br>
**VELA can make all your worries disappear**.
<br>

In fact after you create a table and enter your specific values into it VELA will immediately start **calculating for you** and in no time will suggest the best way you should ship your products.

In addition, thanks to its **ease of use** and **high learning curve**, it allows everyone to be able to use it **quickly and productively from the first time**.
